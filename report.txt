This project was created by Isaac Lipszyc (il17557) and Ben Fozard (bf17813). This is a simple SPA in its very early stages, that uses the Vue framework for the client-side (with Vuetify for nicely working and aesthetically pleasing components) and Express for the server-side. It uses sqlite3 as an embedded SQL database. Could you let us know if the frameworks we are using is okay and wether using material design compenents like vuetify or bootstrap is allowed? Thanks!
