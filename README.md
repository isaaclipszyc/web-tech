Final year paired project for web-tech. We created a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; Vue.js was used for the front end while Node.js and the express frameworks were used for the back end. The website was built for a game, this game takes the classic snake game and puts a fun twist on it. 

For the front end run `npm install -g @vue/cli` and then cd into the client side and run `npm run serve` to run the front end locally on localhost:8081 if that doesn't work try `npm install` when in the client folder and then `npm run serve`.

For the back end run cd into server side and run `npm install -g express-generator` and `npm install --save bcrypt` and `npm install --save multer` before then running `npm install`. Also run `npm i nodemon` and then run `npm run dev` to start the server.
